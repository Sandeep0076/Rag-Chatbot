# Mango Garden Tale

In a lush garden where the air hung heavy with sweet perfume, fifty mangoes glowed like suspended lanterns among emerald leaves. The orchard's caretaker, old Mr. Patel, watched with pride as each fruit swelled day by day, their skins transforming from jade green to sunset hues. One morning, a mischievous monkey slipped through the garden gate, his eyes widening at the bounty before him. He reached for the ripest mango, but paused when Mr. Patel's granddaughter Maya approached with her basket, ready for harvest. "One for you, one for me," she whispered to the monkey, sharing the first golden fruit as birds sang overhead. The fifty mangoes brought together creatures great and small, their sweetness a reminder that the most precious gifts are those we share.
